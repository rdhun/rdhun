# About Me

Hello, my name is Raj and I have background in information and knowledge sciences having completed an MSc in Information and Knowledge Management. 

I am currently learning Python in order to harness its tools analyse data and create data visualisations and am entering as an entry-level data specialist. During my studies, I developed a greater understanding 
of data science fundamentals studying techniques in data analysis, data visualisation and management. I am interested in exploring new data tools and techniques that will further enhance my knowledge. 

This repository is a work in progress to showcase skills, and catalogue my learning journey in data analytics.
